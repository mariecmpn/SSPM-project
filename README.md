# SSPM-project
Data compression by randomized algorithms. Codes in Python used in the project.
Common project with https://github.com/imn167/SSPM-Project.git 

Codes of the project:

- rsvd.py: functions used for the RSVD;
- rsvd_tests.py: tests for the RSVD using the rsvd.py file;
- rcur.py: code used for the CUR decomposition tests;
- tensor_tucker.py: functions used for the Tucker decomposition;
- hosvd_st-hosvd.py: tests for the HOSVD and ST_HOSVD;
- twopass.py: test for the Two-Pass Sketch method;
- onepass.py: test for the One-Pass Sketch method;
- image.png: image used for the HOSVD and ST-HOSVD;
- image2.webp: image used for the Two-Pass and One_Pass algorithms.

Codes were made using the algorithms from the following papers and codes: 
- LOW-RANK TUCKER APPROXIMATION OF A TENSOR FROM STREAMING DATA, from Yiming Sun, Yang Guo, Charlene Luo, Joel Tropp, and Madeleine Udell. 
- FINDING STRUCTURE WITH RANDOMNESS: PROBABILISTIC ALGORITHMS FOR CONSTRUCTING APPROXIMATE MATRIX DECOMPOSITIONS , from Nathan Halko, Per-Gunnar Martinsson, and Joel A. Tropp.
